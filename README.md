## ✨How_to_Prepare_for_DSA✨

✔ Learnt Arrays and Strings from Hackerrank.
######
✔ Learnt basics of all DSA concepts from GeeksforGeeks(see what I mean by this in image)
######
✔ Did practice on InterviewBit for sometime. It has a good set of questions but not very user friendly.
######
✔ Did LeetCode consistently since 2019 end.(with some breaks, see more on my github)

📍 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐤𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐢𝐧 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐝:
######
✔ Always go topic-wise and do related questions.
######
✔ Document your journey in GitHub. It helps to keep yourself accountable for consistency, also recruiters will be confident on you.
######
✔ Make a Google doc and document the question links and it's code which you find extremely difficult and you know you can't solve on your own without a hint(This doc can be used for revision just before your interview as well)
######
✔ Consistency is everything, remove all the distractions.
######
✔ If you can, get a Leetcode premium, I loved the premium solutions.
######
✔ Revise the topics once a month, go to Leetcode and filter solved questions, see how you solved then and if it's difficult to understand, solve it again.

📍𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞: It's going to be hard, very hard at times. you will often question yourself if you are aiming too high or if this is even achievable. Just keep going, it will 
  be all worth it in the end.

I get this question a lot and here I am sharing few things that helped me. ✌️

📍1. Having interview scheduled with the company you really aspire to work for can push you like nothing else.

📍2 . I loved the green GitHub and Leetcode chart. I hated any white gaps.

📍3. I used to watch videos of company tour, joining kit, unboxing and everything available on youtube which helped me visualise myself in that position and to work for it.

📍4. Reading a few pages of a self help book before going to bed can really help you set the mood for the next day. (I read "The magic of thinking big")

📍5. I spend a lot of time on LinkedIn and because of that I came across so many joining posts, instead of being envy I took inspiration from them. I went through their profile, saw that many people are coming from tier-3 college like me and have similar experience and if they are able to make it, I will be able to do it as well.

📍6. Self-belief. I failed a lot, a lot! But deep down I knew I can do it and I will be there one day. Having faith in yourself and your capabilities will help you to recover from failures.

📍7. Todo app is something where I made my next day's hour-wise plan every night.
