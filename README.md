## ✨How_She_Prepared_for_DSA✨

✔ Learnt Arrays and Strings from Hackerrank.
######
✔ Learnt basics of all DSA concepts from GeeksforGeeks(see what I mean by this in image)
######
✔ Did practice on InterviewBit for sometime. It has a good set of questions but not very user friendly.
######
✔ Did LeetCode consistently since 2019 end.(with some breaks, see more on my github)

📍 𝐓𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐤𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐢𝐧 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐝:
######
✔ Always go topic-wise and do related questions.
######
✔ Document your journey in GitHub. It helps to keep yourself accountable for consistency, also recruiters will be confident on you.
######
✔ Make a Google doc and document the question links and it's code which you find extremely difficult and you know you can't solve on your own without a hint(This doc can be used for revision just before your interview as well)
######
✔ Consistency is everything, remove all the distractions.
######
✔ If you can, get a Leetcode premium, I loved the premium solutions.
######
✔ Revise the topics once a month, go to Leetcode and filter solved questions, see how you solved then and if it's difficult to understand, solve it again.

📍𝐓𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐭𝐨 𝐜𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫:
######
Array, Linked list, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph, Recursion, Backtracking, Dynamic programming, Trie, Sliding window.

📍𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐞: It's going to be hard, very hard at times. you will often question yourself if you are aiming too high or if this is even achievable. Just keep going, it will 
  be all worth it in the end.
